# cheatsheet.nvim

A searchable cheatsheet for neovim from within the editor using
[Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
(fallback to displaying in a floating window if Telescope is not
installed), because hoomans suck at remembering stuff:

![cheatsheet.nvim with Telescope](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23398472/120632733-e6191f80-c486-11eb-90d6-e26bacf83c20.png)

<sup>Font: [mononoki](https://madmalik.github.io/mononoki/), Colorscheme: [onedark](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim), [Dotfiles](https://github.com/sudormrfbin/dotfiles2)</sup>

## Quickstart

1. Forget how to do `X`
2. Hit `<leader>?` to invoke cheatsheet telescope
3. Type in `X` and find forgotten mapping/command
4. No more ???
5. Profit !!

## Installation

Installing Telescope is not required, but *highly* recommended for
using this plugin effectively. `popup.nvim` and `plenary.nvim`
are used by Telescope.

Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```viml
Plug 'sudormrfbin/cheatsheet.nvim'
" optional
Plug 'nvim-lua/popup.nvim'
Plug 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'
Plug 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim'
```

Using [dein](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim)

```viml
call dein#add('sudormrfbin/cheatsheet.nvim')
" optional
call dein#add('nvim-lua/popup.nvim')
call dein#add('nvim-lua/plenary.nvim')
call dein#add('nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim')
```
Using [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```lua
use {
  'sudormrfbin/cheatsheet.nvim',
  -- optional
  requires = {
    {'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim'},
    {'nvim-lua/popup.nvim'},
    {'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'},
  }
}
```

## Usage

Use the `:Cheatsheet` command which automatically uses Telescope if installed
or falls back to showing all the cheatsheet files concatenated in a floating
window. A default mapping `<leader>?` is provided for `:Cheatsheet` 
(not bound if alerady in use). By default the `<leader>` key is `\`.

Your cheatsheet file is a simple text file with the name `cheatsheet.txt` found in
`~/.config/nvim/` (`~/AppData/Local/nvim/` if you're on Windows) alongside your
`init.vim`. Use the `:CheatsheetEdit` command to open it in a buffer to edit.

A [builtin cheatsheet](./doc/cheatsheet-default.txt) lists most of the useful
inbuilt vim mappings and commands, useful for people still finding their way
around the editor (and for others wanting to scratch the occasional
I've-been-using-vim-for-years-but-forgot-how-to-scroll-horizontally itch).
Disable it with `let g:cheatsheet_use_default = v:false`.

| Telescope mappings | Description                                                                        |
| ---                | ---                                                                                |
| `<C-E>`            | Edit user cheatsheet Ã  la `:CheatsheetEdit`                                        |
| `<C-D>`            | Toggle `g:cheatsheet_use_default`                                                  |
| `Enter`            | Fill in the command on de commandline. If not a command, print for easy reference. |

Since `cheatsheet.nvim` provides it's own commands,  it is not required to
"load" `cheatsheet.nvim` with Telescope which is usually required for plugins
using Telescope.

## `cheatsheet.txt` File Format

- `#` starts a normal comment, blank lines are ignored.
- `##` starts a metadata comment for specifying sections and tags.

    `## section-name @tag1 @tag2`: here `section-name` is the name of a plugin
    or a simple name to group some cheats together. `tag1` and `tag2` are alternative
    names that you might later remember the section name with. For example the section
    name can be [`sandwich`](https://github.com/machakann/vim-sandwich) and the tag
    can be `@surround`.

- A cheat consists of a description and the key/command/anything separated by `|`

    ```
    Open cheatsheet | <leader>?
    Open cheatsheet in floating window | :CheatSheet!
    ```

See this project's [cheatsheet](./cheatsheet.txt) and the
[default](./doc/cheatsheet-default.txt) included one for more examples.

## For Plugin Authors

You can put a `cheatsheet.txt` file in the root of your repo
([like](./cheatsheet.txt) in this repo) and it will be picked up automatically
and displayed on `:Cheatsheet`.  You don't have to add the file to your repo
*solely* to support searching it using `cheatsheet.nvim` -- the format is
simple enough to be opened and read normally and can serve as a great
quickstart for users.

## Additional Cheatsheets

Cheats for other plugins are collected in [contrib](./contrib/cheatsheet.txt). Ideally
plugin authors would supply their own `cheatsheet.txt`, but since
that is not possible for every plugin, they are collected here.
You can copy them at your leisure.

This plugin was inspired by (and borrowed some code and the default cheatsheat)
from [cheat40](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-cheat40).
